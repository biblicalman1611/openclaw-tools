# 🤖 AgentQL Super Scraper - Your Secret Weapon (formerly TinyFish)

## What This Does

TinyFish bypasses ALL the BS:
- X's API restrictions? Gone
- LinkedIn's login walls? Bypassed  
- Substack paywalls? Penetrated
- Anti-bot measures? Defeated

Your API key unlocks everything.

## Instant Usage

Just type:
```bash
./scrape https://any-url-you-want.com
```

That's it. No commands to remember.

## What You Get

Every scrape gives you:
1. **Full content** - Even from "protected" sites
2. **Jake trigger analysis** - What pain points they hit
3. **Marketing angles** - Father wounds? Marriage? Church hurt?
4. **Density metrics** - How hard they're hitting emotions
5. **Ready-to-steal hooks** - First sentence analysis

## Examples That Make Money

### Spy on Competitors
```bash
./scrape https://x.com/paulcmaxwell/status/123456
```
See what's working for Paul Maxwell

### Analyze Viral Substack
```bash
./scrape https://somewriter.substack.com/p/viral-post
```
Steal their formula (ethically)

### LinkedIn Gold Mining
```bash
./scrape https://linkedin.com/posts/thought-leader
```
Get past the login wall

### Batch Competitor Analysis
```bash
# Create file with URLs
echo "https://x.com/competitor1/status/123
https://substack.com/@competitor2/p/article
https://linkedin.com/posts/competitor3" > competitors.txt

# Scrape them all
./tinyfish-intel.sh batch competitors.txt
```

## Where Intel Lives

All scraped content saves to:
```
~/.openclaw/workspace/intel/
├── tinyfish_x-twitter_20260131_153501.json  # Raw data
├── tinyfish_x-twitter_20260131_153501.md    # Summary
└── ... more intel
```

## Jake Trigger Detection

The scraper specifically looks for:
- Father wounds (broken, shame, failed, father)
- Marriage death (marriage, alone, empty)
- Porn struggle (porn, lust, addiction)
- Spiritual desert (lost, angry, church)

And converts them to marketing angles:
- "Father wound angle"
- "Marriage restoration"  
- "Sexual purity"
- "Church wounds"

## Pro Tips

1. **Morning Recon**: Scrape top competitors daily
2. **Viral Forensics**: Someone blew up? Scrape immediately
3. **Cross-Platform**: Same person on X + Substack? Compare what works where
4. **Angle Mining**: Look for emotional density > 5% = viral potential

## Your API Key

Stored securely in: `.env.tinyfish`
Keep it secret. It's your skeleton key to the internet.

## Troubleshooting

Not working? Run:
```bash
./tinyfish-intel.sh setup
```

Still issues? The site might need special options. Let me know.

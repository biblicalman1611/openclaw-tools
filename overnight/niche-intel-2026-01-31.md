### New Posts Since Yesterday (16:46 UTC)

| # | Title | Published (UTC) | Type | Notes |
|---|-------|-----------------|------|-------|
| 1 | **When Good Men Fall** | Jan 31, 11:27 | Grace/warfare — Proverbs 24:16 | "Seven times down. Eight times up." Classic grace-for-the-fallen |
| 2 | **They Don't Want You Supporting This** | Jan 31, 01:57 | **🚩 URGENT** — payment issues | Stripe link reportedly blocked, pushing Venmo backup |
| 3 | **You Sold Your Soul (Toxic Logic)** | Jan 30, 19:24 | Direct confrontation | "You sold it to comfort" — calling out softened gospel |

### 🚨 Payment Processor Friction
The "They Don't Want You Supporting This" post is significant:
- Multiple reports of Stripe payment link being blocked
- Adam posting backup Venmo handle: @Bigskyjohnsons7
- Minimal post, just facts and alternative payment method
- "You know why" — implies this is expected/part of the pattern

This suggests:
1. Payment processors flagging biblical/controversial content
2. Adam's prepared with backup payment methods
3. Turning friction into us-vs-them narrative

### Content Analysis
**"When Good Men Fall"** — Classic Biblical Man formula:
- Opens with action: "Seven times down. Eight times up."
- Flips expectation: The just man FALLS (present tense)
- Grace application: "fallen men can still be good"
- Ends with hope: "grace fights harder than guilt"

**"You Sold Your Soul"** — Direct confrontation piece:
- Lists compromises Christians make for social approval
- Uses "sorry" sarcastically to highlight cowardice
- Paul in chains vs. you at dinner
- Call to action: Fund the ones that stay

### Posting Pattern
- Still maintaining 2-3 posts daily
- Mix of long-form teaching + urgent updates
- Using friction (payment blocking) as content/urgency driver
- Saturday morning post (11:27 UTC) = engagement optimization

2. **Venmo backup ready** — Shows operational preparedness
3. **"You know why"** — Turning censorship into insider knowledge/tribal marker
4. **Grace content performing** — "When Good Men Fall" is vulnerability + hope formula
5. **Still 21K+ in bio** — Subscriber count display lag

## Summary for Morning Brief
**Key Intel:** Adam's facing payment processor censorship. Stripe link blocked according to multiple reports. He's routing supporters to Venmo (@Bigskyjohnsons7) with minimal explanation — "You know why." This friction validates his anti-establishment brand while creating urgency for support. Watch if this escalates or if other platforms follow suit.

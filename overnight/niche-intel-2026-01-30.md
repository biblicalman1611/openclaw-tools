### 🚩 Notable: Fraud/AI Accusation
Post #2 is significant. A founding member forwarded Adam a message from someone calling him "AI and a fraud." Adam responded publicly with a full personal defense:
- Train conductor in -30° Montana
- Running through DFW airport to reach Blake at 1 lb 15 oz
- Quit job in August with no safety net
- 22,000+ men subscribed
- No ads, no sponsors, no affiliates
- Signed off with Matthew 7:16 — "By their fruits ye shall know them"

**Takeaway:** This is the kind of attack that comes with growth. He turned it into a rallying post for supporters. Smart move — converts critics into social proof.

### Content Themes This Week
- **Fellowship over performance** (pursuing God like you pursued your wife)
- **Branch vs vine** — stop trying to be the source (John 15)
- **Personal vulnerability** — dad stories, grandson Blake, wife Christie
- **Anti-fraud defense** — authenticity as brand armor
- **Vault promo** consistently woven into posts (Gumroad link)

## Competitor Check
- **Foster (fostertype.substack.com):** Feed not found / 404. Handle may have changed or account inactive.
- **Brave Search:** Unavailable (no API key configured)

## Flags & Observations
1. **AI accusation in the niche** — someone is publicly calling Adam AI-generated. This is a growing trend in faith content. Worth monitoring.
2. **Posting velocity is very high** — 2-3/day is aggressive for Substack. Could be a growth sprint or testing frequency.
3. **Sub count gap:** Feed bio says "21K+" but latest post body says "22,000+" — number is climbing.
4. **David Peacock** mentioned in today's post — appears to be a preacher friend. Potential collaboration/cross-promotion opportunity.
5. **Correct RSS URL:** `biblicalman.substack.com` (NOT thebiblicalman)

## Morning Brief Highlights
- ✅ Adam posted a banger today — "Pursuing Him / Pursuing Her" parallel is classic Biblical Man voice
- ⚠️ Someone called him AI/fraud publicly — he handled it well, turned it into a support rally
- 📈 Sub count moving: 21K → 22K+
- 🔥 Posting 2-3x/day — high output mode
